         Progressive Web Apps are experiences that combine
         the best of the web and the best of apps.
         They are useful to users from the very first
         visit in a browser tab, no install required.
          As the user progressively builds a relationship
          with the app over time, it becomes more and more
          powerful. It loads quickly, even on flaky networks,
          sends relevant push notifications, has an icon
          on the home screen, and loads as a top-level,
          full screen experience

          The iOS Software Development Kit (SDK) contains the tools and interfaces needed to develop, install, run, and test native apps that appear on an iOS device’s Home screen. Native apps are built using the iOS system frameworks and Objective-C language and run directly on iOS. Unlike web apps, native apps are installed physically on a device and are therefore always available to the user, even when the device is in Airplane mode.
          The iOS SDK provides the resources you need to develop native iOS apps.

<h3>Features of ios</h3>
<p>
  The biggest improvement in iOS 11 is the App Store. Curation has always been Apple’s strength and now it has become even better. The App Store on iOS 11 is full of big cards that tell you more about apps and games. You could find an in-depth article on how to get better at Pokemon Go, or apps for meditation, with download links to each app mentioned in the piece, while on the App Store. This means that you get a lot more guidance while looking for apps, and it gives curation a personal touch. The App Store also divides apps and games into separate sections, which is a positive change.
